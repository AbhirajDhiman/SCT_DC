# SCT_DC

SCT_DC is a collection of data science / machine learning scripts demonstrating classification tasks such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.  
It includes example implementations on datasets like Titanic and Bank Marketing (or similar), with step-by-step explanations and code.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find

- Clean, well-commented Python code using `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.  
- Implementation of **Decision Tree classifier** and extension to **Random Forest** (or other models)  
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables  
- Model training, evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)  
- Visualizations such as tree plots and feature importance

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhirajDhiman/SCT_DC.git
   cd SCT_DC
Install dependencies
You’ll need Python (3.7+ recommended) and the typical data science libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run scripts
For example:

bash
Copy code
python SCT_DS_1.py
python SCT_DS_4.py
Modify / Extend

Swap in the Bank Marketing dataset (or your own dataset)

Adjust hyperparameters

Add new models (e.g. Logistic Regression, XGBoost)

Add more visualizations (feature importance, ROC curves)

📄 Example: Using Bank Marketing Dataset
Here’s how you might integrate Task 03 and Task 04 into the repository:

Add the Bank Marketing dataset file (e.g. bank.csv)

In one script (e.g. SCT_DS_3.py), implement the Decision Tree classifier, preprocess data, train, evaluate, and show the tree

In another script (e.g. SCT_DS_4.py), implement a Random Forest classifier (or compare multiple models)

Include comments and sections in code so someone reading it can follow the “human way” logic

📈 Results & Metrics
For each experiment / script, be sure to print / log:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

Feature Importance (for tree-based models)

(Optionally) ROC curve and AUC

You can also include these results in this README later (screenshots or markdown tables).

✏️ Tips to Improve
Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters

Cross-validation for more robust evaluation

Use pipelines (sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline) to combine preprocessing + modeling

Experiment with more models (SVM, Gradient Boosting, etc.)

Document assumptions, data cleaning steps, and thought process
